As a college student, I wont lie, I've always been conscious of finding the cheaper option even if it's a couple of dollars. I'm that person who compares prices on apps like Uber and Lyft to get the best deal, leading me to create this app that streamlines this process, ultimately saving valuable time.

The idea of "Save time, ride cheaper, ride better" served as the catalyst for Ride Better, an iOS application meticulously crafted to compare Uber and Lyft prices. This project served as a practical exploration, while learning Swift to build an application allowing me to delve into SwiftUI and MapKit for a hands-on learning experience.

While the app showcases the prowess of SwiftUI and MapKit integration, it's important to note that due to limitations in accessing Lyft's API for real-time pricing based on specific start and end locations, the current version employs hardcoded values. Once Lyft's API becomes available for this purpose, Ride Better will seamlessly integrate these functionalities, offering users a comprehensive and dynamic comparison between Uber and Lyft ride prices.
